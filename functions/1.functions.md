***Functions*** enable you to break down the overall functionality of a script into smaller, logical subsections, which can then be called upon to perform their individual tasks 
when needed!

below is the syntax.

```
function_name () {
    list of the commands
}
```

- below is the example of the function:

```
#!/bin/sh

#We have defined a hello world function here

Hello () {
   echo "Hello World"
}

# calling our function
Hello
```
