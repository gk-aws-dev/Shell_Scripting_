# Shell Scripting:

-> The shell is a command line interpreter, it translates the user entered command and converts them into the language which is understood by the kernel.

-> Shell scripting is nothing but the list of commands which are listed in a script in the order of execution.
# Type of the Shell:

1. `The C shell (csh)`:- It includes helpful programming features like built-in arithmetic and C-like expression syntax.
2. `The Bourne Shell (sh)` :- It is the original UNIX shell. It is faster and more preferred. It lacks features for interactive use like the ability to recall previous commands.
3. `The Korn Shell (ksh)`:- is a superset of the Bourne shell.So it supports everything in the Bourne shell.It has interactive features. It includes features like built-in arithmetic and C-like arrays, functions, and string-manipulation facilities.It is faster than C shell. It is compatible with script written for C shell.
4. `Bourne Again Shell (bash)` :- It is compatible to the Bourne shell. It includes features from Korn and Bourne shell.
