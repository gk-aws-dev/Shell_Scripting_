# Arithmetic Operator:

here a=10 and B=20

```+ (Addition)```--> Adds values on either side of the operator -->   ``` `expr $a + $b` will give 30```

```- (Subtraction)```--> Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand -->``` `expr $a - $b` will give -10```

```* (Multiplication)```--> Multiplies values on either side of the operator -->``` `expr $a \* $b` will give 200```

```/ (Division)```--> Divides left hand operand by right hand operand -->``` `expr $b / $a` will give 2```

```% (Modulus)```--> Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder -->``` `expr $b % $a` will give 0```

```= (Assignment)```--> Assigns right operand in left operand -->```a = $b would assign value of b into a```

```== (Equality)```--> Compares two numbers, if both are same then returns true.-->```[ $a == $b ] would return false.```

```!= (Not Equality)```--> Compares two numbers, if both are different then returns true.-->```[ $a != $b ] would return true.```


# Comparison/ relational operator:

Operator--Meaning--Usage
```
-eq		equal to		        [ $a -eq $b ]
-ne		not equal to		    [ $a -ne $b ]
-gt		greater than		    [ $a -gt $b ]
-ge		greater than or equal to	  [ $a -ge $b ]
-lt		lesser than		      [ $a -lt $b ]
-le		lesser than or equal to 	  [ $a -le $b ]
```
